### LeaderBoard api 

To interact with this this api here's the url `https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api` <br>
endpoint  **/games/:id/scores/** <br>
possible methods `GET POST`

#### Add new player 
You would use `{method: "POST"}` and send body in `JSON` format, e.g `{body: {user: name, score: num}}`

#### Get scores 
You can use endpoint **/games/:id/scores/** <br> 
But this time you will use `{method: "GET"}` also don't forget to use method `.json()` to parse result
<br>
